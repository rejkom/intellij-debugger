# Master Debugging in IntelliJ IDEA: Java Course — Maven Project Overview

Welcome to the Maven project for the **"Master Debugging in IntelliJ IDEA: Complete Java Guide"**
course. This repository contains all source code, exercises, and practical examples referenced throughout the course,
helping you solidify your debugging skills with real modern Java scenarios.

## About this Project

This project is designed to let you practice professional debugging techniques in modern Java. All code is structured
according to the Maven standard directory layout, making it easy to build, run, and extend using both IntelliJ IDEA
Community and Ultimate editions.

You will find Java classes and exercises aligned with each course section, covering classic bugs, advanced debugging
strategies, regular expressions, Java features, and concurrent programming. Each example is ready for step-by-step
walkthroughes in the debugger.

## Key Features

- **Hands-On Debugging Exercises:**  
  Each core topic introduced in the course is backed by a dedicated Java class. You’ll encounter common bugs (null
  pointers, logic errors, array bounds), and use the debugger to trace and fix them.

- **Java Example Code:**  
  Features such as virtual threads, pattern matching, and structured concurrency are integrated so you can practice
  debugging with the latest language capabilities.

- **Regex Debugging:**  
  Special classes demonstrate how to debug regular expressions with IntelliJ’s built-in regex tools, including the "
  Check RegExp" intention.

- **Exception Handling & Breakpoint Strategies:**  
  Learn to use conditional breakpoints, exception breakpoints, watches, and method/field breakpoints—all demonstrated
  with targeted exercises.

- **Remote Debugging Configuration:**  
  Includes ready-to-use settings for attaching the IntelliJ debugger to a running remote JVM.
